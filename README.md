# LinkedIn-Clone
React JS LinkedIn clone tutorial using Firebase, Redux and Material UI. - Features Firebase authentication, and hosting.

## Lessons Learned 
An exciting dive into React Redux, encountered a number problems that I had to overcome to integrate firebase as this was my first time using firebase as a backend.
Getting familiar with Redux devtools. Overall an interesting project with many lessons learned.

## Future Improvements
* Integrating an API key to pull live data for the linkedin news section, I think this would be a great feature to add and it's something I'll look at in the future.
* Currently the posts are not interactive, a future feature I'd like to incorporate is the icons to be interactive allowing users to like, comment and share.
* Creating a mobile responsive first approach
